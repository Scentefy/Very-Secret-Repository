<span id="h.h9mzilzatpii" class="anchor"></span>Daily Stand-up meetings

**What is it?**

Short daily meetings help to keep the team up to date with understanding the overall progress of the project. This practice is initiated by the **scrum master** to start a quick status report meeting with the team.

**Who is involved?**

Anyone who is directly involved with the project is expected to attend and contribute to the report. Others who aren’t are advised not to interfere or to simply not attend these meetings.

**When will this be done?**

It is best to plan a set time of the day for the meeting to be held. Starting the day with a stand up is recommended.

**How do we do it?**

This meeting contains the 3 following questions which must be answered

1.  What did you do yesterday?

2.  What problems did you encounter?

3.  What you will do today?

One member is permitted to speak at a time to answer these questions and the order can be decided by the scrum master. If there is anything that is not needed to be discussed between the whole team, the conversation can wait until after the stand-up.

This is effectively used in person and in front of an information radiator (eg. Scrum board, Burn down chart, etc.) of the overview of the project. Although it works most effectively in person, the stand-ups can be held over video call as well.

<span id="h.5yoy9w2sog" class="anchor"></span>Open Agile office space

**What is it?**

Software Development is done in an open work space environment which facilitates face-to-face interaction within close proximity between team members..

**Who is involved?**

Everyone in the team involved with the project.

**When to include this?**

It is advised to prepare and ensure an open working space earlier on in the project.

**How will this be done?**

Agile teams can do this by removing single cubicles and creating team work spaces (seen in the link below). This can also be done by creating adhoc team meeting spaces, which consist of large open areas with moveable desks and chairs. Information radiators should be placed in visible locations in close proximity within the work space.

<span id="h.7rxnna11jn6u" class="anchor"></span>Cross functional teams

**What is it?**

Agile development teams encourage the use of incorporating a multitude of skill sets which contribute to the project and also to the shared knowledge of the team.

**Who is involved?**

Anyone and Everyone who is directly involved with the project who can bring insight and increases the knowledge base within the team.

**When should this be done?**

Teams should be formed at the start of the project. Adding members during the project will need consideration as they will have to be brought up to speed with the problem domain.

**How will this be done?**

-   Planning

All plans within the team should be done together. This includes everyone directly involved in the project to collaboratively create a product backlog which contains the features of the product. This product backlog is then estimated by effort by the development team and is prioritized by the Product owner.

Learning together

Teams should share ideas and methods on how to approach a problem domain. This facilitates increasing the shared knowledge within a team, thus increasing the understanding of what solutions should be applied to the problem.

**Requirements engineering**

**User stories**

**What is it?**

User stories are used to capture features from the perspective of the end user. This is a description of what the user wants to do and why.

**Who is involved?**

End users, Product owner, Development team, pretty much anyone involved can write user stories.

**When should this be done?**

At the beginning of the project from the initial high level requirements and later on in the project when new functionalities are added to the product.

**How will this be done?**

User stories are short and simple descriptions that can be written at many levels of complexity, which can represent the different functionalities and features of the product. A user story is written to describe a scenario where a feature is used. This is then coupled with an acceptance criteria, effort estimation and is prioritized inside a product backlog.

Anybody can write user stories, however it is recommended that the stakeholders write them up as they have different perspectives compared to the developers working on the product. Developers however, can create user stories derived from high level requirements, with the assistance of the end user’s and product owner’s conversations, made with Business logic (a language that can be understood from the user’s perspective).

**Project planning and Progress Tracking**

**Information radiators**

These are graphical displays placed in a highly visible area, preferably within the project teams work space. These displays are updated regularly with information about the project. The use of these displays are effective to track progress for the project with simple metric figures. Eg. Scrum Task board, Risk and issues chart.

**Who is included?**

Everybody participates as information radiators are are used to keep up-to-date with the project's progress and for the team to visually update data within the charts/boards where the entire team can see them.

**When will this be done?**

Information radiators such as the Scrum Task Board and Risk management chart should be set up from the beginning and updated throughout the whole project.

**How will this be done?**

Information radiators should be set up close by or within the team’s workspace for a quick and efficient referential guide on the project’s state, goals, roles and progress.

**Iteration planning and development**

Software is developed in iterations called Sprints, which tasks itself to create minimal marketable features to the product owner and their stakeholders.

Creating Sprint Backlogs, breaking down User Stories into smaller tasks, estimating effort needed for each User story, and deciding what features may be needed to be included in the future should be done when deciding what to do next for the next sprint.

**Who is involved?**

Developers and Product owner.

**When will this be done?**

After a sprint iteration completes.

**How will this be done?**

If the product owner decides to change or add more functionality to the product, the same process of creating user stories from the features is repeated. If there is a lack of understanding to make an acceptable user story, further conversation will be needed to be discussed with the product owner.

**Managing Change**

**Empowerment**

Agile development teams are self organizing and self managing. This includes team members being able to self-assign tasks from the pool of tasks that need to be completed during the Sprint, and being able to manage their own work by keeping progress and up to date with the rest of the team.

**Who is involved?**

The entire team.

**How will this be done?**

This is done by team members who can be responsible for managing and undertaking tasks to execute themselves, otherwise, it is best to ask help from the rest of the team to assign tasks to each other.

**Quality assurance**

**Pair programming **

**What is it and how is it done?**

An Agile technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. One acts as the code writer and the other works as the observer who reviews the lines of code the code writer writes. The roles are switched frequently.

**Demos**

**What are they?**

A demonstration of the deliverables functionality is presented to the product owner and stakeholders at the end of each Sprint.

**Who is involved?**

Stakeholders, product owner and development team.

**When is this involved?**

At the end of the sprint iteration

**How will this be done?**

The deliverables functionality is demoed in front of project stakeholders and the product owner. This is then coupled with acceptance testing from the product owner who would then either recommend changes to the deliverable if needed. This is then put back into the product backlog and prioritized for the next iteration.

**Test-Driven Development**

A process that involves writing tests to the view of the expected result from a functionality, then developing code that will successfully satisfy the prior-written test code.

**Who is involved?**

Developers, Stakeholders, Product owner.

**When will this be done?**

Tests are made before developing any new functionalities to ensure that those specific functionalities will end up working successfully,.

**How will this be done?**

The tests are first written in a way that will be satisfied by the functioning code. These tests are created from User Stories which assist in developing deliverable functionalities within the

product.

**Retrospectives**

These are team meetings held at the end of a Sprint to provide clarity on what went well, what didn’t go so well, and what can be improved for next iteration.

**Who is involved?**

The project team.

**When is this done?**

At the end of each sprint.

**How will this be done?**

Team retrospectives are an internal evaluation of performance of the previous sprint iteration held with the development team. One way of doing it is by assess with the team what needs to be done, what should be stopped and what should be continued to be done. After the range of ideas have been written down the team can vote on which points to focus on for the next sprint.

**What is it?**

Comes after the Demo with the product owner giving input on the project.

**Who is involved?**

Development team, Product owner

**When will this happen?**

After Demoing the deliverable

**How will this be done?**

The Product owner and Stakeholders assess the performance of the team through comparing the deliverables to the desired goal of the sprint and their perceived idea of their product. Recommendations are made if any, the development team notes them down.these are then made into prioritized user stories be put into the product backlog.
