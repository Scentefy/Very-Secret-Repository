**Work Approaches and Practices**

We have decided to adopt the following agile practices to give structure to the execution of the project, and ensure that the project is fully understood and delivered in a timely manner.

**Stand ups and Meetings :**

This will be utilized to ensure that there is a constant flow of progress information and status of any impediments affecting the completion of the task being worked on.

The two types of stand ups we will be usings are facebook post standups and face to face/video call.

facebook post standups will be posted in the morning daily by the Chairman and group members are to comment on what they have done, what problems that they have faced which is stopping progress and what they will do today. We have chosen this method even though it does not support dynamic conversation, they do though allow our team keep up with our status of progress with our varied schedules.

Face to face meetings and video calls will be done once a week to address larger collaboration tasks and decisions made for direction of writing.

**Close Proximity **

This will be facilitated with people who are working on the same deliverable and to a greater extent the whole group to ensure that collaborative work is done in close proximity of to the collaborative member(s) for everyone concerned with the development of the deliverable to understand the collaborative approach and act accordingly to ensure that duplication of work does not occur and team members are able to assist effectively.

**Burn down charts **

This will be used to aid our product delivery to see a graphical representation of how much progress has been planned to be completed to how much work has actually been completed.

This chart will be used daily at the stand ups to reference the progress of the project and during the retrospective to address what aided/impeded our progress and what was planned well/poorly.

If the previous sprint deliverables were not completed on time or took longer than expected, we will use this information to address the problems and reschedule the next sprint accordingly.

**Milestones (deadlines)**

This Document will give us a clear set of structured deadline to structure our sprints and deliverables around it. We will use it as a reference when planning for sprints in the future as it will give us a guide how much effort will be required for production of subsequent deliverables. This would also help with workload balancing.

**Information radiators : Trello board, Facebook group **

These tools will be used to support our agile practices and will be managed by the chairman and the task manager and updated frequently by the team. They will be used as a visual references for progress, coordination and workload distribution.

**Sprint Time boxed tasks**

Treating each deliverable as a task and breaking it into sections with a specific purpose which one person can work on. Each deliverable has a deadline attached to it which is the end of each sprint.

**Sprint iterations**

We will be using sprints to timebox each deliverable in a 10 day time period to ensure that there is constant development and urgency to meet structured deadlines.

**Planning poker **

This technique of estimating effort needed to finish each deliverable will be conducted on our second set up meeting during this sprint 0 period. This will be then rendered on the milestone document and referred to when building the burndown chart.

**Sprint Retrospectives**

This will be a reflective meeting that will be held in person or over video call to ask what went well, what did not go well and what we would want to apply to the next sprint execution and planning.

**User involvement**

We will be interacting and questioning the client through email often to fill in the gaps in our knowledge with the requirements of the deliverables.
