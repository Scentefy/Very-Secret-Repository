**Work Approaches and Practices**

We have decided to adopt the following agile practices to give structure to the execution of the project. This will ensure that the project is fully understood and delivered in a timely manner.

**Stand ups and Meetings**

These will be utilized to ensure that there is constant flow towards the project’s progress and also bring attention to the status of any impediments that will affect the completion of the tasks being worked on.

We will be using two types of stand ups which will include Facebook post standups and face to face meetings/video calls.

Facebook post standups will be posted in the morning daily by the Chairman, and group members are to comment their progress on what they have done, what problems they have faced (which is stopping the progress) and what they will do today. Although this method doesn’t support dynamic conversation, it does, however, allow our team to keep up with the status of our progress with our varied schedules.

Face to face meetings or video calls will be done once a week to address larger collaboration tasks and decisions.

**Close Proximity**

This will be facilitated for team members who are working on the same deliverable and to a greater extent, the whole group. This is to ensure that collaborative work is done in close proximity, which will aid in our collaborative approach and allow our team members to act accordingly so that duplication of work does not occur.

**Burndown Chart**

This will aid in our product delivery to provide a graphical representation of how much progress has been planned to be completed, and how much work has actually been completed.

This chart will be used in our daily stand ups to refer to our progress on the project and also during the Team Retrospective to address what had aided/impeded our progress and what was planned well/poorly.

If the previous sprint deliverables were not completed on time or took longer than expected, the information will be used to address the problems that had occurred and also to reschedule our future sprints accordingly.

**Milestones (Deadlines)**

This document will give us a clear insight of structured deadlines to our sprints and the deliverables within it. We will use it as a reference when planning for sprints in the future as it will give us a guide to how much effort will be required for the production of the subsequent deliverables. This would also help with workload balancing between the team.

**Information radiators: Trello board, Facebook group **

These tools will be used to support our agile practices which will be updated frequently by the team and managed by the Chairman and Task Manager. They will mainly be used as visual references for the project’s progress, coordination and workload distribution.

**Sprint Time boxed tasks**

We will be treating each deliverable as a task and break them down into sections with a specific purpose in which one person can work on. Each deliverable has a deadline attached to it, which will be the end of each sprint.

**Sprint iterations**

Sprints will be used to time box each deliverable in a 10 day time period, ensuring that there is continuous development and an urgency to meet structured deadlines.

**Planning Poker**

This technique of estimating effort needed to finish each deliverable will be conducted on our second set-up meeting during this sprint 0 period. The results will then be rendered on the milestone document and be referred to when building the burndown chart.

**Sprint Retrospectives**

These will be reflective meetings that will be held in person or over video calls to discuss what went well, what didn’t go well, and what would be applied to the next sprint plannings and executions.

**User involvement**

We will be questioning and interacting with the client through emails often, in order to fill in the gaps of our knowledge regarding the requirements of the deliverables.
