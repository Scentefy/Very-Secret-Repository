**Schedule Plan - Software Engineering Assignment 1B**

**Very Secret After the Meeting Team**

**What we will do**

The purpose of this project is to recommend a project approach with a set of suitable practices and tools that would be suitable for case study 1. The recommendation will be a set of deliverables to assist the case study team in familiarizing themselves with the recommended project approach, as well as with practices and the tools involved with the approach. Product and Project related deliverables will be produced to satisfy the criteria of this project.

**Project related deliverables include:**

-   The Team Agreement

-   Work Breakdown Structure

-   Work Approach and Practices

-   Evidence of development process

-   Two sets of Retrospectives (See Appendix for WBS Dictionary)

-   Project Wiki

**Product related deliverables include:**

-   A report

-   An executive summary

-   Practices and tool guides

-   Learning package

**Case Study Selection**

The project team is provided with three case studies, in which the team is required to select one study and recommend a project approach with appropriate reasons. In terms of the selection process, the team was interested in choosing a study that provides the best quality of describing its context. With this mind-set, the team members agreed to undertake this project based on case study 1, regarding a “Software Associated with a new robotic health device which will work in hospitals”.

**Work Distribution**

As the project team consists of four team members, it is important to ensure each member contributes towards the developmental progress of the project. Our team will incorporate a “Sign-up” mechanism on Trello in order to allow each team member to choose which task they want to undertake during each sprint.

The method of maintaining version control and the integration of deliverables will be done with the use of GitHub. Different sections of a deliverables can be modified concurrently within their own “branch” and can be integrated into the “master branch” once verified by the team. Once all deliverables on the master branch are finalised, the team will submit the work via AUTOnline wiki.
