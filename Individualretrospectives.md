1.1. Two things you did well.
-----------------------------

-   Delegating work and sometimes allowing to team members according to their strengths choose the work they're going to do. This is to ensure that the work is done efficiently and to higher standard.

-   Communicating clearly what I am working on through reporting on stand ups regularly and keeping my delegated tasks on the task board updated.

1.2. Two things you could improve. How?
---------------------------------------

-   Improve on clarifying a baseline expectation of people's work ethics and style towards the beginning of the project to ensure the project methodology can fit their mentality. Also if need be create alterations to practices to accommodate earlier within the project than later.

-   Maintaining a larger vision of the project and how the end product will be structured has been challenging. Seeing one small aspect of the project as it is right now and sometimes losing sight of the bigger picture occurs, this has hindered the dependencies of some other deliverables, to make sure that there is a sound flow between the deliverables.

1.3. Two things you have learned during this project.
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Learning that collaboration of a team is heavily reliant on the team having good time management skills, especially when the majority of the work is not done at the same time and in the same place.

-   Learned that people have limits and the best way to working around it is the best approach as people do not like to be changed. Influencing tactfully and gently is the best approach to dealing with a conflict of interest and dedication.

2.1. Two things you did well.
-----------------------------

> There are some factors that I consider doing well, but as this section states, I am only required to provide two scenarios that I think I have done well.
>
> The first factor is the commitment of researching on tools to populate the Project Tools Guide. Given the opportunity to research on tools also allowed me to gain information about the practices recommended by the team. For example, Researching on retrospective tools such as Retrium has allowed me to rediscover an efficient process of running a retrospective. Taking this into consideration, not only have I learned about various tools but also the practices these tools accommodate. With this information, I was able to share my understanding to one of my team members to help them with their contribution towards the Project Tools Guide.
>
> Another factor is the effort to ensure correctness of the Learning Package. Each deliverable for this project is important and should be considered high-quality. I did not feel satisfied with the effort I have put towards this document. Hence, requiring me to ensure the quality of this deliverable. This was done by proof-reading the content and make any changes or additions to the representation of the deliverable. For example, including a description on Who, What, Where, When and Why a retrospective is important as it has been lacking from the previous version of the Learning Package. Extra graphical representation has also been included to provide clarity of the content.

2.2. Two things you could improve. How?
---------------------------------------

> With positive contribution, there is always negativity towards my contribution towards the project. These factors are specifically related towards my work ethics and how I have been collaborating with my team to produce these deliverables.
>
> The first factor is constant missing in action. This is mainly due to other commitments I have besides this project. With these commitments, It has been difficult for me to communicate with my team face-to-face, cancelling or unattending group meetings in the process. This has created a substantial impact towards the team’s motivation to do work as each team member relied on each other to contribute towards the project. This factor can be improved by making time for group meetings to ensure my opinion can be heard from the team. The use of online tools to compensate for absence and also be taken into consideration, but should not be recommended.
>
> The second factor is inconsistency of work. Provided the disadvantage of multiple commitments, work has been left until the last few days before their due date. This negatively impacted the team as it provides little time for quality assurance. In order to improve on this factor, better time management should be taken into consideration. Spreading out the workload throughout the duration of the project will allow time for other team members to apply quality assurance as constant work are being produced little by little.

2.3. Two things you have learned during this project.
-----------------------------------------------------

> It is a given for a student to learn from a project they are contributing in, whether it maybe facts about the practices applied to the project or information about what is being researched.
>
> A lesson learned in terms of project practices is sprint backlogs aren’t always completed within their sprints. This could be due to impediments that may have occurred during the sprint and prevents the team from proceeding. Fortunately, the application of agile practices on a project compensates for the lack of completing the sprint backlog during a sprint. Reprioritizing and including incompleted tasks into a new sprint ensures completeness.
>
> A lesson learned in terms of the research is the importance of retrospectives. As a an agile project is subdivided into many sprints or processes, the use of retrospectives can be utilizes to improve each coming sprint or process… This is true if the retrospective is done properly. With the many techniques provided to run a retrospective, the risk of an ineffective retrospective is reduced, ensuring each sprint of process is an improvement of the previous.

====================

3.1. Two things you did well.
-----------------------------

-   I had kept my communication consistent throughout the project as I believe that I did reply to a person unless the statement was directed at the group, keeping communication is important as it allows a greater visibility through the project.

-   I also had kept my kept my flow of work also consistent through the project and try to complete my given section as I didn’t want to let down the team.

3.2. Two things you could improve. How?
---------------------------------------

-   I had maybe asked for help too many times in the project and I need to be more self reliant to stop disturbing my other teammates, so I will have to do more of a sturdy research then go to my teammates for help if I cannot find what i wanted.

-   I could improve on being less passive in a discussion, where I can input in a discussion and could possibly change it.

3.3. Two things you have learned during this project.
-----------------------------------------------------

-   I have learnt how to skim read articles and implement it into a report then reference it

-   I have learnt that there will be conflict in a team and a way to fix it.

=============

4.1. Two things you did well.
-----------------------------

-   Utilizing piktochart, an infographic tool which I used to produce our executive summary as it had to be easy to read for busy but intelligent people.

-   Communicating and collaborating with the team to learn about the different practices and tools throughout the project together, by researching and recommending them for the case studies. For example the ‘Follow the Sun’ approach for project teams working in different countries or the tool Retrium which is a really helpful tool for holding project team retrospectives.

4.2. Two things you could improve. How?
---------------------------------------

-   Checking the storyboard more frequently is something that I will need to do more often as it lead me to forget important tasks that had to be done.

-   I will need to post on daily standups earlier even if i haven’t gotten the task that i have specified the previous day done yet. This was due to the fact that I would be working on that specific task from the previous day so that I would have something to write on the daily stand up.

4.3. Two things you have learned during this project.
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Good communication between the team regarding the project objectives and goals are the key to a successful project. Many misunderstandings and problems can arise if tasks to be done aren’t conveyed clearly to the team. It is also very difficult to be productive with the project if a team member doesn’t respond to team messages being sent in a group chat. Asking for opinions about the work you have done from the team are good way to ensure that your work is up to standard. Feedback in general can help to motivate and boost your productivity with the amount of quality of your contribution towards the project.

-   Retrospectives are a helpful way to ensure better team work and also allow a better understanding towards our previous and next Sprints. Retrium is an efficient tool that our team used for two of our three team retrospectives. It was much more helpful than the first team retrospective we held and allowed us to write our opinions without anyone knowing who wrote them, therefore giving truthful opinions regarding how our previous Sprints did. It also allowed us to review an action plan based on those opinions which is helpful to be used as a guide for the next Sprint.
