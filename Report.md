1. Introduction to context
==========================

A large New Zealand based health organization is planning to release an extensively researched robotic health device which will support work done in hospitals. A variety of staff with an experienced and rigid set of skills from different internal departments within the organization are planning to have a two step phase with their development of this product. The first phase will utilize an ad hoc team to create a “proof of concept” functional model in New Zealand. The second phase will then be undertaken in concurrency by heavily plan driven teams from Vancouver and Vietnam to complete the full development of the product.

Throughout the whole project there will be a need for an extensive coordination of efforts, close to the beginning and even more so towards the end with geographically separated teams. There will also be a need for user involvement and stakeholders such as the health board and hospital staff who will use this technology. Finally, extensive testing and quality assurance will be needed for this project due to the robotic health device being such a critical product that could possibly affecting life or death scenarios.

The product owner is up to the company to select a candidate to represent the wants and needs of the end users in the respective medical sector the robot device is aimed at.
2. Methodology Recommendation
=============================
####2.1 Phase A
#####2.1.1 Lean with Agile Practices

The main points we are highlighting to justify the use of the Lean practice for the first phase of the project is that firstly, it allows for faster development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a product that delivers customer value, which is fitting for their Ad hoc prototyping approach. This allows for speed and efficiency in developing a working prototype as it focuses on developing functional requirements over non functional requirements. 

Therefore bringing greater return on investment of development resources and reducing the risk of over-engineering. Reason being that requirements is understood faster by the developers of the team and if their understanding is incorrect it can be corrected quickly within the MVP compared to a full scale product. 

Some things that need consideration when using this methodology will require a second phase to construct the fully developed product pushing the delivery date further than if it were a one phase project. The project context fits this point well as the health organization plans for a two phase development approach.

Communicating using Citrix GoToMeeting and documenting clearly when passing the project to the second phase teams will ensure that the first phase team’s code can be reused. This will clearly show the points of concern (bottlenecks, data growth, etc) which can be made to assist the teams in phase two.
####2.2 Phase B
#####2.2.1 Plan driven lean with Agile Practices
Given that the Vietnam and Vancouver teams have been using a company specified plan driven approach, it would be sensible to suggest to add supporting agile practices and lean which is a flexible approach.

Lean supports can support the idea of building the first version of the product fast, then building the marketable version right. Since phase A produces a prototype with focusing on building functionality rather than modularity, this would mean that there would be short cuts within the prototype that was built to just work. Hence this is where phase B comes and addresses the problems of the prototype had. Using the Lean approach allows for Phase B to be mindful of what good and bad decisions made by the first project team resulting in better project decisions for the product. Thus this would result in better usability design, focusing on core functionality also better technology and libraries used to create the product.

The first phase is used for understanding the requirements and creating a product backlog  populated with user stories for the project from the extensive research and base functionality of  the MVP created. The User stories are then prioritized and estimated by effort points with use of the research and the experienced team's discretion.

Then in the second phase they extensively plan ahead using company specific plan prioritized user stories created in a backlog and used to create a Gantt chart for progress monitoring.

The Development of this product is broken into sprints where the top priority items of the backlog is taken and then put into a sprint backlog. This backlog is then used to show the end users what goals have been set out for the sprint to compare to what they have accomplished.

These sprints are plotted onto deadlines set in their Gantt chart and on those deadlines a showcasing phase that is initiated with end users with a demo of the deliverables deliverables to provide feedback on their work. If any changes are suggested they are added and edited in the product backlog.

On the same day a  retrospective is then started separately with teams within their residing country and the resulting comments and recommendations is posted online for both Vietnam and Vancouver teams to read each other's retrospectives.

This then would evidently increase the pressure to alter the plan alongside with the gantt chart hence a day is allocated for planning and estimating a reasonable goal considering the retrospectives if the goal is unsuccessful or there is a major change end users are collectively asking for. 
#####2.2.1 Collaborative international Software Development approach

The second phase of the project also consists of handing over the project to two teams. These two teams are located in Vancouver and in Vietnam. Hence, the difference in timezones should be taken into consideration when handing over the project from the New Zealand team, to these two offshore teams. Although differences in timezone and other attributes seems to be considered a disadvantage for offshore projects, there are many ‘partially realised’ benefits to the organization of this project (Conchuir, Ågerfalk, Olsson & Fitzgerald, 2009)

Based on the ‘Follow The Sun’ development stated by Carmel, Espinosa, & Dubinsky (2010), the difference in timezones can be utilized for continuous development (Conchuir, Ågerfalk, Olsson & Fitzgerald, 2009). As night falls on one side of the globe, the sun rises on the other side. This concept gives the idea that teams from one side of the globe can continue work as teams from the other side rests. Hence, the effectiveness of continuous development.

The difference in location gives many benefits to the organization. Firstly, accessibility to skilled developers increases with the more locations involved with the project. With an increased range of skilled developers, there is an increased range within the skill pool to distribute and target functionality development effectively.

Another benefit based on difference in location is for closer proximity to the market and customers. The organization can analyse the market situations of all three locations, giving them the knowledge of trend within these locations. It also simplifies the process of interacting with the organization’s customers and increases the knowledge of market needs.

Scrum of Scrum meetings will also assist in passing specific information and important details that can’t be conveyed via documentation, while also increasing the quality assurance and understanding for both teams. Scrum of Scrum meetings include both teams within phase B. 




The process of the Scrum of Scrum meeting will begin at the end of each work day where the team that will be passing the project work over will hold their own Daily Scrum meeting. The project team will then designate a team member who has the most understanding and knowledge of events and issues that had happened over the course of the working day, to hold a Scrum meeting with the other international team’s designated team member, who will then pass the information on by holding a Scrum meeting with their own project team. This Scrum of Scrum meeting cycle will repeat until the entire project has been successfully completed. (“Mountain Goat Software,” 2007).

The designated team members will utilize Citrix GoToMeeting, a web conference software tool to hold online meetings that require no need for face-to-face interaction. This tool will be helpful to the phase two teams which are based in different countries.

3. Lean principles for both phases
==================================
####Build Quality In
The aim is to Build quality into the product as early as possible during the development process and continually during the development phase. This also includes quality assurance techniques such as test driven development, frequent integration, constant feedback and Pair programming.  It also increases the efficiency of development by including practices such as test automation and decreasing time between iterations.
#####3.1 Test driven development 
It goes without saying that any software project desires to be executed efficiently and produce   quality code. The tool trello is able to assist this principle by allowing people to create acceptance criterias for each card therefore creating a test to develop off. Test driven development supports understanding of the product and leads to increase the external and internal code quality and also a general increase of productivity. As opposed to Testing what was last developed, the advantages of writing the test cases first is not available and thus developers do not have the opportunity to gain greater understanding of the product they are making.

Hence test driven development across both phases is recommended to create a product that meets the needs of the end users.

#####3.2 Constant Feedback - Inspecting and adapting
Using the tool Citrix GoToMeeting will allow you to present your product to the product owner and allows the product owner to input some feedback, the meeting will also be recorded to have this to be referenced off. Having a constant 2 way feedback between the team and the product owner allows the team to understand the vision and needs of the product owner. Considering that the company already has taken a considerable time to undertake product research, this information would help guide discussions between teams and product owners. It would also increase the efficiency and value taken out from these meetings hence assisting with creating a better product for the end user
#####3.3 Decreasing time between Development stages
This is to encourage fixing bugs as soon as possible instead of logging it for later affecting the integrity of the project and increasing the waste. Also long periods between logging a bug and testing it decreases the continuity of a developer team, this results in delays caused by lack of focus and task switching. 
#####3.4 Frequent integration
Decreasing the time between developing and integrating stable versions of the product is ideal after testing is complete on the module. This is to reduce the difference gap between the versions of software which hence reduces the integration phase and regression testing. This ultimately will save time and keep an up to date version of the product online between the international teams avoiding major merge conflicts.
#####3.5 Pair Programming
Applying two minds onto the same task the result benefits from the collective experience of two developers as opposed to just one. Although this at times may or may not provide increased productivity it allows for developers to feel more satisfied and assured that their work is correct.
#####3.6 Test Automation
Test Automation ensures that the development team does not waste effort on repetitive testing tasks. This is to ensure quality assurance while increasing efficiency. Using the Atlassian tool will assist with test automation also keep the developers focus on the main objective rather than repetitive testing.

#####3.7 Respect People
This entails that prompt responses, listening attentively and respecting other people's opinions by giving them some thought, not shooting them down on sight. This is key to software development and ultimately international software development teamwork. Many messages can be lost in translation and misunderstandings can happen between different cultures, hence it is extremely important to show respect within the team and its entirety.

#####3.9 Suggested Supporting Practices effects
#####3.10 Balanced use of internal software documentation
=======
#####3.8 Suggested Supporting Practices effects
#####3.9 Balanced use of internal software documentation
>>>>>>> origin/master
Documentation is essential for effective communication in terms of the project development processes. They can be shared to other stakeholders of the project and often consist of information such as project planning, development information and also issues that have occurred throughout the duration of the project. Eventually, documentations become beneficial for project development and maintenance (Mira, 2005), but effort is required to maintain these documents throughout the life cycle of the project. Hence, the use of effective documentation containing critical information on the operations of the project and code are necessary for both phases of the project.

Firstly for the cohesive coordination of development teams for the first phase and even more so for the second as the scale of development increases. Secondly for the handover of the MVP clear coding and functionality documentation. It is important for the Vancouver and Vietnam teams to clearly take advantage of the knowledge generated from the development of the prototype.
#####3.10 Facilitated knowledge sharing

The organization has many departments and experts in the areas that are involved in the product, allowing the use of cross functional teams to enable knowledge sharing amongst the project team. This means that with an increased knowledge base and an addition of 4 years of research, the developers would have a firm understanding of the requirements and functionalities that will be needed for the product. Overall, this would effectively facilitate the reduction of misunderstood requirements made when developing the product and development of valuable functional deliverables. 
#####3.11 Increased visibility of the status of other teams and the entire project
This project involves more than one team which means it will be hard to keep a clear vision over the entire project. The agile practices will help to increase visibility of the project through continuous integration and iteration which will allow the project teams to be able to keep track of the statuses of other teams.(L. Lagerberg and T. Skude, "The impact of agile principles and practices in large-scale software development projects) shows empirical evidence where project visibility is resulted from daily meetings, facilitated knowledge sharing and information radiators which all have been leading up to effective coordination within the project team. 

In phase 2, the project will be handed over to be developed by two teams which are based in Vietnam and Vancouver. These teams will have meetings during at the end of the work day or early in the morning, depending on their time zones, to report what they have done. This will provide each team with the status of the project and therefore will increase the efficiency of the product.
#####3.12 Use of metrics
Using metrics within projects allows project members to track their progress and has many benefits, this will increase the visibility to all the members as will be tracking their progress as well as other people in their proximity. Using metrics will be able to simplify the complex aspect of software development therefore stakeholders have a clarified view of the project.

Metrics support achieving goals such as burn down charts, they are used so team members will not spend too much time perfecting their task and allow a visibility on how they are doing with the project. 

Metrics are used to balance workflow by limiting how a person works will stop them from overworking therefore providing other tasks more balance, This will be done by having a steady flow of requirements.

Metrics are used by the user to provide a satisfactory level, this will help teams to understand the quality level of the product whether to improve other aspects of the product. This can be used to improve the product before the release as well from pre-released customer surveys.
#####3.13 Effective coordination, with less overhead.
Agile contains many important factors that can contribute to effective coordination between Agile Software Development teams. Cross functional teams, as explained before in the section ‘Facilitated Knowledge Sharing’, can allow effective knowledge sharing by reducing the amount of handovers between the teams within the company. 
#####3.14 Team proximity
A close proximity in office space between cross functional teams is also very important, however since the company teams will be spread across throughout Vietnam and Vancouver, it would be difficult for cross functional teams to work together effectively. Daily meetings can be time consuming but are an effective coordination mechanism. Task boards allow each individual to know how and what they need to complete at anytime. This is only effective inside teams rather than between teams, however, it allows an insight of for each team to know what other teams are doing.

One big issue that would occur between the Vietnam and Vancouver teams would be the difference in time zones and language barriers. Coding will be done entirely in english in order to avoid different variations of the code being made each time it is handed off. This will provide quality assurance, preventing mistakes and misunderstandings being made when developers from both teams. Translators may be needed on each team to provide better communication between teams, to avoid confusion and miscommunication on what they are trying to achieve throughout the developmental process.The teams will need to communicate and discuss regarding what they have done and handover work that has been done since their last meeting. These meetings will have to occur during the end of the day or early in the morning, depending on their time zones due to there being a 14hr difference between both countries.
#####3.15 Possibly increased productivity
(L. Lagerberg and T. Skude, "The impact of agile principles and practices in large-scale software development projects) has a table that shows productivity increases as they progress through sprints. Productivity is increased through the uses of agile methodology, this allows teams to focus on the main tasks and keeps progress on track through sprints. All the project tools will support and increase the productivity within the first phase and the second phase through the uses of agile practices.


4. Learning Package
===================
A learning package can be used to upskill the team with a recommended practice. This learning package will cover the importance of retrospectives, especially within the agile methodology. Retrospectives should be applied in agile projects due to its encouraging nature to improve the process of the project based on the team’s experience. With the learning package, the project team will learn the fundamentals of retrospectives, the variety of techniques and the process of executing a retrospective. This learning package also includes activities to help the project team to learn the benefits of retrospectives. 

The learning package is a powerpoint with information about retrospectives. It is recommended that the project team shall upskill with this learning package as the team. This is because the activities as well as the process of running a retrospective requires the presence of a team. In terms of duration, the learning package will take approximately 4 hours with the laid out timebox for the activities of the learning package.



Conclusion
To summarize the use of lean helps the two phase operation of building it fast then building it right. This is supported by the lean principles which help with team collaboration and communication. In Addition extra agile practices has been selected to increase visibility, team synergy and knowledge sharing. These practices and principles are thereby supported  with many project control, communication, information radiator and coding tools which assist both the ad hoc team in phase A and the multitudes of international teams in Phase B to achieve project success
