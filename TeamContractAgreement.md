**Mechanisms adopted for work allocation:**

-   We have decided to incorporate the “Sign-up” Agile practice on our Trello storyboard to ensure that each team member will be able to choose what they want to work on.

-   We have also adopted planning poker which will help us realise which tasks require more effort than others. We will use “effort points” with a scale from 1-10.

**Decision Making Process to handle conflict**

-   When we have conflicts we will have to explain why, and will keep voting until we reach a reasonable consensus.
