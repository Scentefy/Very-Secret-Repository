There are many computer-based software engineering tools that can be used as a virtual representation of some scrum tools. Many have integrated these functions as part of their project management software \[PMS\], but Trello is a suitable example for a collaborative representation of most agile artefacts. Trello can provide a way to accommodate Collaboration and Communication, Requirements Engineering, Project Planning and Progress Tracking, and Change Management.

Although Trello can be a suitable PMS for such approaches as lean, it lacks a way to ensure quality assurance for the product that is being developed. In order to compensate for this missing area, the integration of another software or tool maybe be necessary.

Agile Tools
===========

Before getting into the details of how Trello can accommodate for the areas mentioned above, it is recommended to become familiar with the artefacts that are commonly used in the agile methodology.

A task board is a common artefact used in many methods of the agile methodology. They are used by the project team to give an indication on the progress of a task from the current product backlog. This ensures the project team has knowledge of developing the minimal marketing feature in terms of it’s ‘time cycle’ and the project team can make decisions to modify the rate at which a specific task is being pulled from the backlog and into completion. For example, a member is unable to implement a specific feature… The project leader assigns another member to assist him into implementing this feature. A task board is a good example of how a project team can collaborate and provide changes to alter the rate at which the product is being developed.

Collaboration and Communication
===============================

*Trello is a collaboration to that organizes your projects into tools* (Trello Inc. n.d.). It does so by organizing your tasks such as it would on a task board. Trello allows collaboration by giving its users the privilege to share their task boards with other users. Hence, the task boards can be managed by the project team.

**Notifications**: Notifications in Trello are pretty straightforward. By default, users always receive notifications about recent card activity (i.e. new comments, changes, and additions) and any upcoming due dates. Users also get automatically notified if they are mentioned in a comment or checklist item, are added to a card, board, or organization, or are made an admin-level user. When notifications are received, a bell-shaped button in the top right corner of the screen turns bright red. If you do *not* choose to click on the red bell and view your notifications as they pop up on your screen, you will later receive a default email that contains all unread communications. Happily, users can even control the frequency of these email notifications or opt out of them all together.

**Collaborative Features**: Multiple users can work together on a Trello board. It is even possible to bring in outside collaborators at any time simply by emailing them an invitation to join your organization or sending them a link to a board.

Project Planning and Progress Tracking
======================================

The task board follow the categorisation of tasks in terms of their progression. The image below shows a standard task board layout. Depending on the project team, the categories can vary for further clarification on the progress of a task. Under each category are a list of tasks that have been selected to be completed during the current sprint. As each task is relatively small and can be done by a single team member, each member is given the opportunity to undertake their desired tasks and relocate these tasks according to what they think which category fits their selected task. Though, it is recommended for the project team to determine whether a task is considered “completed”.
