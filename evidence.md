Evidence of Development
Very Secret After the Meeting Team


Collaboration
Meeting Minutes
Holding meetings to communicate to plan collaboratively together was used. From these meetings notes were taken and a physical photograph of what was whiteboarded is taken.

Facebook Stand-Up posts

Use of facebook stand ups were used to keep track of team members progress and alerted whenever they were having any issues.












Retrium - Retrospectives

Use of Retrium was used in our second sprint to compensate for our increasingly busy schedules. With this we decided to hold our retrospective with voice call and the retrium web application

planning and tracking
Trello
This was used to give a visualisation of the progress of the project and what needs to be done by whom. We also decided to customise it into a quest themed board with quests to be completed, quests under progress, Quest completion verification and quest completion list.

Burndown charts
Discontinued after sprint 2:
Because not able to reach continuous work flow with other commitments. Thus we implemented todo, writing, drafted, proof reading and completed list structure. where the measure for amount of work to be completed can be seen  by looking at the to do list for the sprint.

version control
Github
Decided to use Github to keep our version control of our documents. We would push our newer versions of the documents once passing the proofreading stage.This repository also took care of maintaining a history of a major version changes of our deliverable documents

Google Docs
Google Docs has a revision feature which allows for granularity further than github. This can assist with looking at new changes to a long document that a team member has recently added to. This has mainly assisted us with proof reading constantly updated documents. 
















quality assurance
Trello List & Acceptance Criteria
A Trello list on the project board is dedicated to show documents which need proof reading. Acceptance criteria defined by the team for acceptable quality of documentation is also used for inspecting documents to assure quality assurance. This gives us a visual overview of documents needing proof reading and criteria which helps the proof reader.

Proofreaders change depending on whom the inspection officer chooses to elect if it is not herself.
